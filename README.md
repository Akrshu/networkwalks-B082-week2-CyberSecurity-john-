### 🎯 Objective

Gain practical exposure to fundamental cybersecurity concepts through hands-on security challenges, including password security, hashing, wordlists, and CTF-style problem solving.

**Skills covered:**

| 🧩 Area | 📖 Focus |
|---|---|
| Cybersecurity Fundamentals | Core concepts & terminology |
| Security Testing Methodology | Structured problem solving |
| Password Security | Weak vs. strong passwords |
| Hashing Concepts | One-way transformations |
| Wordlists | Dictionary-based attacks |
| Password Cracking | Practical recovery workflow |
| CTF Challenges | Flag-based validation |

### 🔑 Password Security & Hashing

Passwords aren't usually stored directly — instead, systems rely on **cryptographic hashes**, a one-way transformation producing a fixed-format representation of the original input.

**Practical workflow:**

```
Protected File
     ↓
Hash Extraction
     ↓
Hash Identification
     ↓
Password Cracking
     ↓
Password Recovery
     ↓
Access to Protected File
```

### 🧰 Networkwalks Password Cracker

Practiced against a lab file: `My Locked PDF1.pdf`

**Steps followed:**

1. 📥 Download the encrypted lab PDF
2. 🧮 Open the Networkwalks Hash Calculator
3. 📤 Upload the protected PDF
4. 🔍 Extract the PDF hash
5. 📋 Copy the hash (starting with `$pdf$`)
6. 🖥️ Open the Networkwalks Password Cracker
7. 📝 Provide the extracted hash
8. ▶️ Start the cracking process
9. ⏳ Wait for password recovery
10. 🔓 Use the recovered password to open the PDF

### 🧠 Wordlists & Password Cracking

Password-cracking effectiveness depends on:

- 📏 Password length
- 🔀 Password complexity
- 🎯 Password predictability
- 📚 Wordlist quality
- 🔡 Character combinations
- 🌐 Search space
- ⚡ Available computing resources

> 💡 **Key takeaway:** Weak and predictable passwords are significantly easier to recover than strong, unique ones.

## 🔓 Module 2 — Password Cracking with NetworkWalks Tools
<img width="1600" height="840" alt="hashcalculator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e94157ee-48df-4928-b731-518c915f9b5e" />
<img width="1600" height="840" alt="pass cracker" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35877680-6694-45c4-9fff-a817b72985b7" />

### 📌 Overview

In this module, I worked on password cracking using the **NetworkWalks password-cracking tools**. The practical focused on understanding how password hashes are generated/extracted and how those hashes can be tested against password wordlists to recover the original password.

The complete workflow was performed in a controlled cybersecurity training environment for learning and ethical-security purposes.

### 🎯 Objectives

- 🔎 Understand the concept of password hashing
- 🧮 Generate/extract password hashes using the NetworkWalks Hash Calculator
- 🧠 Understand commonly used hash algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1
- 🔗 Use the generated hash as input for password cracking
- 📚 Perform dictionary-based password cracking using the NetworkWalks Password Cracker
- ✅ Verify the recovered password
- 🚩 Successfully capture the provided training flag

### 🧠 Concept — Password Hashing

A password hash is a fixed-length representation generated from a password using a hashing algorithm.

During the practical, the **NetworkWalks Hash Calculator** was used to generate hashes from text, providing outputs for algorithms including:

| Algorithm | Notes |
|---|---|
| MD5 | ⚠️ Legacy — not secure for passwords |
| SHA-1 | ⚠️ Legacy — not secure for passwords |
| SHA-256 | ✅ Stronger |
| SHA-384 | ✅ Stronger |
| SHA-512 | ✅ Stronger |

> 💡 The practical demonstrated that older algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1 should not be considered secure choices for storing passwords.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🧮 **NetworkWalks Hash Calculator** — used to generate password hashes and work with hash values.
- 🔓 **NetworkWalks Password Cracker** — used to attempt recovery of the original password from its hash using a wordlist-based approach.

### 🔄 Practical Workflow

```text
Input Password/Text
        ↓
NetworkWalks Hash Calculator
        ↓
Generate Hash
        ↓
Identify/Select Hash Type
        ↓
Provide Hash to Password Cracker
        ↓
Use Password Wordlist
        ↓
Cracking Process
        ↓
Password Recovered
        ↓
Verify Result
        ↓
Capture Training Flag
```

### 🔎 Step 1 — Generate the Hash

Text was entered into the **NetworkWalks Hash Calculator**, which generated multiple hash representations of the input, including MD5 and SHA-1.

This helped in understanding how the same input can produce different hash values depending on the hashing algorithm used.

### 🔓 Step 2 — Password Cracking

After obtaining the hash, the **NetworkWalks Password Cracker** was used. The hash was provided to the cracker along with an appropriate password wordlist.

The tool tested candidate passwords against the target hash until a matching password was identified.

**✅ Result:** The password was successfully cracked as:

```
password1
```

### 🚩 Step 3 — Flag Capture

After successfully recovering the password, the corresponding training flag was obtained — confirming the password-cracking workflow was completed successfully.

**Captured flags from this practical:**

```
🏁 nw[networkwalks_flag_260821_1]
🏁 nw[networkwalks_persistence_jtr_270521]
```

### 📸 Practical Evidence

Screenshots were captured during the practical to document:

- 🧮 Hash generation using the NetworkWalks Hash Calculator
- 🔢 Hash values generated for different algorithms
- ⚙️ Password-cracking configuration
- ▶️ Password-cracking process
- ✅ Successful password recovery
- 🚩 Successful flag capture

### 🧪 Key Learning Outcomes

- ✅ How password hashing works at a practical level
- ✅ How different hashing algorithms produce different hash values
- ✅ How hashes can be used as inputs during password-recovery attacks
- ✅ How dictionary/wordlist-based password cracking works
- ✅ Why weak and predictable passwords are easier to recover
- ✅ The importance of strong password policies and secure password-storage mechanisms
- ✅ How cybersecurity training environments use flags to verify successful exploitation or challenge completion

### 🔐 Security Takeaways

- 🔓 Weak passwords can be recovered relatively easily when they appear in common wordlists
- 🛡️ Password hashes should be protected even though they are not plaintext passwords
- ⚠️ Legacy hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1 are unsuitable for modern password storage
- 💪 Strong, unique passwords significantly increase resistance to dictionary-based attacks
- 🧂 Modern password storage should use dedicated password-hashing mechanisms with appropriate salting and work factors

### ⚠️ Ethical Consideration

All password-cracking activities in this module were performed in a controlled cybersecurity training environment provided for educational purposes. Password cracking should only be performed on systems, accounts, files, or hashes for which **explicit authorization** has been provided.

### ✅ Module Status

**Project Module 2 — Completed Successfully 🎯**

`Hash Generation → Hash Analysis → Password Cracking → Password Recovery → Flag Capture`
